Impervium
=========
Impervium is a completely custom server software for Starbound.


###Contribute
Impervium is open source to give anyone who has knowledge of the Java programming language a chance to help improve it. However, there are some guidelines for contributing, but have no fear, because they're simple guidelines.

#####Guidelines:
* Do **NOT** leave whitespace characters at the end of files.
* Do **NOT** push any code that does not work.
* Do **NOT** push any unused code.
* More guidelines may be added in the future.


###Compiling
Official Impervium Builds are compiled to run with Java 6. The reason for this is to allow people who do not stay up-to-date with the latest Java versions to run Impervium without needing to download anything prior to running it.
